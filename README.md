# Notes-Making-Application

The main objective of the noteâ€™s making app is to create their own notes and perform some DML operation on it. This is an application that helps you create, edit, update, and delete notes. It's like having a digital notebook where you can jot down your thoughts, ideas, or important information.

1. **Technologies used**: The application is built using ReactJs, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the content respectively.

2. **Features**:
   - **Create, Edit, Update, and Delete**: You can create new notes, edit existing ones, update them with new information, and delete notes you no longer need. This makes it easy to keep your notes organized and up-to-date.
   - **Emoji Option**: Besides just text, the app also lets you add emojis to your notes. This allows you to express your emotions or add a bit of fun to your notes beyond just writing.

3. **User Experience**: The app is designed to provide a seamless experience for users to manage and organize their notes. Whether you're adding new notes, making changes, or deleting old ones, the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
